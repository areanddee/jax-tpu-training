# JAX TPU Training - TODO List

## High Priority

### 1. Clean Colab → GitHub Workflow 🔑
**Problem**: Currently can't commit/push changes from Colab to GitHub
**Solution needed**: 
- [ ] Create Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub
- [ ] Store PAT securely in Google Drive `Tokens/` directory  
- [ ] Add PAT setup to `setup_workspace_hybrid.py`
- [ ] Test commit/push workflow from Colab
- [ ] Document the secure token workflow for team

**Implementation:**
```python
# Auto-configure git authentication from stored token
with open('/content/drive/MyDrive/CoLab-TPU-Projects/Tokens/github_pat.txt', 'r') as f:
    token = f.read().strip()
!git remote set-url origin https://{token}@github.com/areanddee/jax-tpu-training.git
```

### 2. TPU Runtime Testing 🚀
**Problem**: Current demo only tested on CPU
**Solution needed**:
- [ ] Test `Hybrid-Jax-Demo.ipynb` on TPU runtime
- [ ] Verify RK4 performance improvement on TPU vs CPU
- [ ] Test setup script TPU detection and JAX[tpu] installation
- [ ] Document any TPU-specific issues or optimizations
- [ ] Add performance comparison to demo notebook

**Test scenarios:**
- Fresh Colab session → TPU → Run demo
- CPU session → Switch to TPU → Re-run demo  
- TPU session → Switch to CPU → Verify graceful fallback

## Medium Priority

### 3. Shared Token Management 🔐
**Extends**: Clean workflow (item #1)
**For future**: HuggingFace, Weights & Biases, etc.
- [ ] Create `Tokens/` directory structure in Google Drive
- [ ] Add token template files with instructions
- [ ] Secure token loading utility functions
- [ ] Team documentation for token management

**Token directory structure:**
```
CoLab-TPU-Projects/Tokens/
├── README.md                    # How to set up tokens
├── github_pat.txt              # GitHub Personal Access Token
├── huggingface_token.txt       # For model downloads
├── wandb_token.txt             # For experiment tracking
└── .gitignore                  # Never commit tokens!
```

### 4. Enhanced Demo Documentation 📚
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks (CPU vs TPU timings)
- [ ] Create troubleshooting section for common TPU issues
- [ ] Add notebook explaining JAX vectorization benefits
- [ ] Document the RK4 implementation and why it's a good demo

### 5. Team Onboarding Validation 👥
- [ ] Test complete workflow with actual contractor account
- [ ] Verify Google Drive permissions work end-to-end
- [ ] Create contractor setup checklist
- [ ] Test session recovery after timeout

## Low Priority

### 6. Advanced Features 🔧
- [ ] Automatic sync GitHub ↔ Google Drive on notebook save
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- [ ] Template notebooks for common tasks
- [ ] Integration with experiment tracking (Weights & Biases)

### 7. Code Organization 🗂️
- [ ] Move setup script utilities to separate module
- [ ] Add error recovery for network issues
- [ ] Create development vs production configurations
- [ ] Add logging for debugging setup issues

## Completed ✅

- [x] Hybrid workspace setup (GitHub + Google Drive)
- [x] Basic JAX RK4 vectorized demo working
- [x] Google Drive folder structure and permissions
- [x] README documentation with demo instructions
- [x] Local and Colab environment detection
- [x] Folder structure synchronization

## Notes

**Current Status**: System works well for read-only operations and new development. Main gap is committing changes back to GitHub from Colab.

**Priority**: Focus on #1 (Git workflow) and #2 (TPU testing) first, as these are blocking team productivity.

**Security**: All token storage must be in Google Drive only, never committed to GitHub.
